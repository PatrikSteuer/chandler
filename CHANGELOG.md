# chandler Change Log

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

chandler is in a pre-1.0 state. This means that its APIs and behavior are subject to breaking changes without deprecation notices. Until 1.0, version numbers will follow a [Semver][]-ish `0.y.z` format, where `y` is incremented when new features or breaking changes are introduced, and `z` is incremented for lesser changes or bug fixes.

## [Unreleased][]

* Your contribution here!
* If Chandler can't find any version tags, print an error message rather than exiting silently.
* Add `--tag-prefix` option to allow for other Git version tag formats (e.g. `myapp-v1.0.0`; see [#3](https://github.com/mattbrictson/chandler/issues/3))

## [0.1.2][] (2015-10-26)

* Fix Windows test failures introduced in 0.1.1

## [0.1.1][] (2015-10-26)

* Work around parsing issues caused by non-breaking spaces in change logs (e.g. SSHKit)

## 0.1.0 (2015-06-19)

* Initial release
